# REsampliNg methOds for machIne leaRning
**renoir** is an R package providing an analytical framework for robust and reproducible machine learning analyses.

The idea behind **renoir** is to implement a scalable, modular and open-source software for the standardised application of machine learning techniques to high-dimensional data.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = 'articles/figures/renoir_workflow.png', error = FALSE)
```

**renoir** allows for a robust estimation of the true error of a learning methodology by implementing a multiple random-sampling approach spanning different training-set sizes, and computing mean performance metrics with confidence intervals.

Appropriate *unsupervised* pre-processing strategies for initial dimensionality reduction are integrated to facilitate the correct application as part of the process. 

For each considered train-set size, the evaluation of the learning methodology is based on the training and testing of the models over multiple independent train/test sets of data generated via random sampling, bootstrapping or k-fold cross-validation, the training set used to build the models, the left-out set to assess the performance. The computed measures of assessment are then used to obtain an estimate of the mean performance and the related 95% confidence interval.

Different *supervised* feature screening strategies are implemented and incorporated in the learning steps, i.e. before the training/tuning of the models.

Regression and classification problems for binomial data are currently supported.

## Installation

* Install latest development version from GitHub (requires [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package):
  
  
```{r install_dev, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("alexb-84-dev/renoir", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = FALSE)
```
