</h2>
<p><strong>renoir</strong> is a package that evaluates a chosen machine
learning methodology via a multiple random sampling approach spanning
different training-set sizes.</p>
<p><strong>renoir</strong> has been developed thinking about a
teaching/learning abstraction. There are two main actors in the
<strong>renoir</strong> framework: the learner, and the evaluator.</p>
<ul>
<li>The learner represents the learning method under assessment and is
linked to the <code>?Learner</code> class.</li>
<li>The evaluator is responsible for the evaluation procedure, i.e. the
assessment of the performance of the learner via multiple random
sampling, and it is related to the <code><a href="../reference/Evaluator-class.html">?Evaluator</a></code> class.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example in the <a href="#quick-start">Quick Start</a> will help
you in familiarizing with these concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quick-start"></a>
</h2>
<p>In this section we will briefly go over the main functions, basic
operations and outputs.</p>
<p>First, we load the <code>renoir</code> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://github.com/alebarberis/renoir" class="external-link">renoir</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; Warning: package 'Matrix' was built under R version 4.2.3</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For this brief example, we decided to show the functionality of
<strong>renoir</strong> for a classification problem. Let us load a set
of data for illustration:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/data.html" class="external-link">data</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">binomial_example</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The command loads an input matrix <code>x</code> and a response
vector <code>y</code> from a saved R data archive.</p>
<p>Now we want to set a seed for the random number generation (RNG). In
fact, different R sessions have different seeds created from current
time and process ID by default, and consequently different simulation
results. By fixing a seed we ensure we will be able to reproduce the
results of this example. We can specify a seed by calling
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html" class="external-link">?set.seed</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">#Set a seed for RNG</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html" class="external-link">set.seed</a></span><span class="op">(</span></span>
<span>  <span class="co">#A seed</span></span>
<span>  seed <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">5381L</span>,                   <span class="co">#a randomly chosen integer value</span></span>
<span>  <span class="co">#The kind of RNG to use</span></span>
<span>  kind <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Mersenne-Twister"</span>,      <span class="co">#we make explicit the current R default value</span></span>
<span>  <span class="co">#The kind of Normal generation</span></span>
<span>  normal.kind <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Inversion"</span>       <span class="co">#we make explicit the current R default value</span></span>
<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As reported in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>, the main
actors in <code>renoir</code> are the <code>?Learner</code> and
<code><a href="../reference/Evaluator-class.html">?Evaluator</a></code> classes, and these are also the main elements we
need to set up before running our analysis.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="learning-methods">Learning Methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-methods"></a>
</h4>
<p>Let us start with the <code>?Learner</code>. A <code>?Learner</code>
is a container for the different essential elements of the learning
methodology we want to evaluate. In this example, we will focus on just
three elements, i.e. the learning procedure, the sampling approach, the
performance metric.</p>
<p>As a first step, we need to select a learning methodology to
evaluate. A list of supported methods is available through the
<code><a href="../reference/list_supported_learning_methods.html">?list_supported_learning_methods</a></code> function call.</p>

<p>For this example, we choose a generalized linear model via L1 penalty
(the <strong>lasso</strong>) as learning method. From the table, we can
see that the default hyperparameter of the method is

<p>We can see how <strong>renoir</strong> currently supports three
sampling scheme: random sampling with and without replacement, and
cross-validation. They all provide options for a stratified approach,
where a so-called ‘proportionate allocation’ is attempted to maintain
the proportion of the strata in the samples as is in the population. On
the other hand, only random sampling and bootstrap allow for balancing,
meaning that the proportion of strata in the sample is attempted to be
balanced.</p>
<p>For this example, we decided to tune the parameter via a stratified
10-fold cross-validation.</p>

<p>As expected, now only the metrics for classification problems are
listed. Let us select the misclassification error (also called
classification error rate) as performance metric.</p>
<p>So, overall we want to train a model with a <strong>lasso</strong>,
tuning the hyperparameter <code>lambda</code> via 10-fold
cross-validation and by using the misclassification error to assess the
performance of the models.</p>

<p><code>renoirl</code> is a <code>list</code> containing two elements
of class <code><a href="../reference/Renoir-class.html">?Renoir</a></code>, each providing all the relevant
information of the evaluation procedure. There are two elements because
<code>renoir</code> tries to select two different final configurations
during the tuning procedure: one configuration (called <code>opt</code>)
is the configuration having a mean performance during the chosen
repeated sampling procedure which is the optimum value when compared
across all the others, e.g. the configuration with the minimal
classification error rate; the other (called <code>1SE</code>) is the
configuration resulting from the application of the so-called <em>one
standard error rule</em> which consists in selecting the most
parsimonious model having a mean performance within one standard error
from the optimum.</p>

</h4>
<p>We can also visualize the results by executing the <code><a href="../reference/plot-methods.html">?plot</a></code>
function. For example, let us plot the results of the evaluation when
considering the full set of data:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/plot-methods.html">plot</a></span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">renoirl</span><span class="op">[[</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">]</span><span class="op">]</span>, measure <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"class"</span>, set <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"full"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="../reference/figures/renoir_gs_opt_binomial.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Each circle corresponds to the performance of a trained model. The
mean performance metric (i.e. the mean misclassification error) computed
from the model performance scores for each training-set size is shown as
an orange line, while the related confidence intervals are drawn as
bands around the mean. The red square represents the overall best model
selected via an internal procedure: for example, when considering the
misclassification error, renoir selects a potential best model by
choosing the model with the minimal score across all the models fitted
using the training-set size showing the lowest upper bound of the 95%
CI. In this example, the plot shows a quite constant mean score around
0.03 across training-set sizes, indicating a good performance of the
classifier.</p>
<p>To facilitate the inspection of the results, it is also possible to
produce an interactive plot by setting the argument
<code>interactive = TRUE</code> in the <code><a href="../reference/plot-methods.html">?plot</a></code> command.</p>

plot can now be zoomed by selecting an area:</p>
<p><img src="../reference/figures/zoom_renoir_plot_looped.gif" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Some information is also shown when hoovering over a plot element.
For example, if you try to hoover over the red dot representing the best
model you should be able to see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="../reference/figures/renoir_gs_binomial_opt_full_hoover_best.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The top row indicates the position on the x and y axes: the selected
model has a training-set size of 681 and a misclassification error of
0.029. Please, note that the circles are slightly jittered from their
position for a clearer plot, but the values reported while hoovering are
correct. The second row is reporting the iteration index corresponding
to the model: in this case, the 4th model trained during the repeated
sampling procedure was selected as the best model. No supervised
screening was performed, and the model contains 9 features. Finally, the
value of <code>lambda</code> resulted from the tuning and that was used
to train the final model is reported.</p>

<p>Now that we have identified a potential model of interest, we may
want to extract from the <code>Renoir</code> object. We can easily do it
by using the <code><a href="../reference/get_model.html">?get_model</a></code> command. It requires three
arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>object: an object of class <code>Renoir</code>
</li>
<li>n: the sample size to consider</li>
<li>index: index of the model to select</li>
</ul>

<p>The model can now be used for further analysis. For example, we may
want to use it for prediction.</p>

<p>We could also be interested in the non-zero features of the model.
For this task, we can use the <code><a href="../reference/features.html">?features</a></code> command. The two
main arguments are:</p>
<ul>
<li>object: an object of class <code>Trained</code> or
<code>Tuned</code>
</li>
<li>type: a string indicating whether to return <code>all</code>
features or just the ones with non-zero coefficients
(<code>nonzero</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="global-features-importance">Global Features Importance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#global-features-importance"></a>
</h4>
<p>Finally, we might want to investigate the features importance across
all the models. We easily extract this by using the
<code><a href="../reference/signature.html">?signature</a></code> command and specifying the performance metric to
consider and the set.</p>
