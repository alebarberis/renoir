</h2>
<p><strong>renoir</strong> is a package that evaluates a chosen machine learning methodology via a multiple random sampling approach spanning different training-set sizes.</p>
<p><strong>renoir</strong> has been developed thinking about a teaching/learning abstraction. There are three main actors in the <strong>renoir</strong> framework: the learner, the evaluator, and the marker.</p>
<ul>
<li>The learner represents the learning method under assessment and is linked to the <code>?Learner</code> class.</li>
<li>The evaluator is responsible for the evaluation procedure, i.e. the assessment of the performance of the learner via multiple random sampling, and it is related to the <code><a href="../reference/Evaluator.html">?Evaluator</a></code> class.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example in the <a href="#quick-start">Quick Start</a> will help you in familiarizing with these concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quick-start"></a>
</h2>
<p>In this section we will briefly go over the main functions, basic operations and outputs.</p>
<p>First, we load the <code>renoir</code> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">renoir</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For this brief example, we decided to show the functionality of <strong>renoir</strong> for a classification problem. Let us load a set of data for illustration:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/data.html" class="external-link">data</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">binomial_example</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The command loads an input matrix <code>x</code> and a response vector <code>y</code> from a saved R data archive.</p>
<p>Now we want to set a seed for the random number generation (RNG). In fact, different R sessions have different seeds created from current time and process ID by default, and consequently different simulation results. By fixing a seed we ensure we will be able to reproduce the results of this example. We can specify a seed by calling <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html" class="external-link">?set.seed</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="co">#Set a seed for RNG</span>
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html" class="external-link">set.seed</a></span><span class="op">(</span>
  <span class="co">#A seed</span>
  seed <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">5381L</span>,                   <span class="co">#a randomly chosen integer value</span>
  <span class="co">#The kind of RNG to use</span>
  kind <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Mersenne-Twister"</span>,      <span class="co">#we make explicit the current R default value</span>
  <span class="co">#The kind of Normal generation</span>
  normal.kind <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Inversion"</span>       <span class="co">#we make explicit the current R default value</span>
<span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As reported in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>, the main actors in <code>renoir</code> are the <code>?Learner</code> and <code><a href="../reference/Evaluator.html">?Evaluator</a></code> classes, and these are also the main elements we need to set up before running our analysis.</p>

</h4>
<p>Let us start with the <code>?Learner</code>. A <code>?Learner</code> is a container for the different essential elements of the learning methodology we want to evaluate. In this example, we will focus on just three elements, i.e. the learning procedure, the sampling approach, the performance metric.</p>
<p>As a first step, we need to select a learning methodology to evaluate. A list of supported methods is available through the <code><a href="../reference/list_supported_learning_methods.html">?list_supported_learning_methods</a></code> function call.</p>

<p>For this example, we choose a generalized linear model via L1 penalty (the <strong>lasso</strong>) as learning method. From the table, we can see that the default hyperparameter of the method is <code>lambda</code>.</p>

<p>We can see how <strong>renoir</strong> currently supports three sampling scheme: random sampling with and without replacement, and cross-validation. They all provide options for a stratified approach, where a so-called ‘proportionate allocation’ is attempted to maintain the proportion of the strata in the samples as is in the population. On the other hand, only random sampling and bootstrap allow for balancing, meaning that the proportion of strata in the sample is attempted to be balanced.</p>
<p>For this example, we decided to tune the parameter via a stratified 10-fold cross-validation.</p>

<p>We can see that the <code><a href="../reference/list_supported_performance_metrics.html">?list_supported_performance_metrics</a></code> function reported the performance metrics for both regression and classification problems.

<p>As expected, now only the metrics for classification problems are listed. Let us select the misclassification error (also called classification error rate) as performance metric.</p>
<p>So, overall we want to train a model with a <strong>lasso</strong>, tuning the hyperparameter <code>lambda</code> via 10-fold cross-validation and by using the misclassification error to assess the performance of the models.</p>

<p>Now that our main actors are set, we can run the analysis. <strong>renoir</strong> provides a single command for this purpose, the <code><a href="../reference/Renoir.html">?renoir</a></code> function. The essential required elements are a <code>?Learner</code>, an <code><a href="../reference/Evaluator.html">?Evaluator</a></code>, the predictor matrix <code>x</code>, the response variable <code>y</code>, and the response type <code>resp.type</code>. Since our chosen learning method has one hyperparameter (<code>lambda</code>), we also need to provide a <code>hyperparameters</code> element, where we supply our sequence of values that will be used during the tuning of the model.</p>

<p><code>renoirl</code> is a <code>list</code> containing two elements of class <code>?Renoir</code>, each providing all the relevant information of the evaluation procedure. There are two elements because <code>renoir</code> tries to select two different final configurations during the tuning procedure: one configuration (called <code>opt</code>) is the configuration having a mean performance during the chosen repeated sampling procedure which is the optimum value when compared across all the others, e.g. the configuration with the minimal classification error rate; the other (called <code>1SE</code>) is the configuration resulting from the application of the so-called <em>one standard error rule</em> which consists in selecting the most parsimonious model having a mean performance within one standard error from the optimum.</p>

<p>Each circle corresponds to the performance of a trained model. The mean performance metric (i.e. the mean misclassification error) computed from the model performance scores for each training-set size is shown as an orange line, while the related confidence intervals are drawn as bands around the mean. The red square represents the overall best model selected via an internal procedure: for example, when considering the misclassification error, renoir selects a potential best model by choosing the model with the minimal score across all the models fitted using the training-set size showing the lowest upper bound of the 95% CI. In this example, the plot shows a quite constant mean score around 0.03 across training-set sizes, indicating a good performance of the classifier.</p>
<p>To facilitate the inspection of the results, it is also possible to produce an interactive plot by setting the argument <code>interactive = TRUE</code> in the <code><a href="../reference/plot-methods.html">?plot</a></code> command.</p>

plot can now be zoomed by selecting an area:</p>
<p><img src="../reference/figures/zoom_renoir_plot_looped.gif" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Some information is also shown when hoovering over a plot element. For example, if you try to hoover over the red dot representing the best model you should be able to see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="../reference/figures/renoir_gs_binomial_opt_full_hoover_best.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The top row indicates the position on the x and y axes: the selected model has a training-set size of 681 and a misclassification error of 0.029. Please, note that the circles are slightly jittered from their position for a clearer plot, but the values reported while hoovering are correct. The second row is reporting the iteration index corresponding to the model: in this case, the 4th model trained during the repeated sampling procedure was selected as the best model. No supervised screening was performed, and the model contains 9 features. Finally, the value of <code>lambda</code> resulted from the tuning and that was used to train the final model is reported.</p>
