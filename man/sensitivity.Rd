\usage{
sensitivity(true, pred, weights = NULL, multi, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{true}{a vector (or a matrix) of observed values. If a matrix is provided,
a multi-response is assumed}

\item{pred}{a vector (or a matrix) of predicted values}

\item{weights}{observation weights (not implemented yet)}

\item{multi}{what to do when response has multiple output values
\describe{
\item{\code{average}}{errors of multiple outputs are averaged to get a single value for each observation}
\item{\code{micro}}{the score is computed by using the global number of true positives, false negatives and false positives}
\item{\code{macro}}{scores of different classes are averaged by unweighted mean to get a single value. Class imbalance is not taken into account}
\item{\code{weighted}}{scores of different classes are averaged by weighted mean to get a single value. Weights are number of true instances per class. It takes into account label imbalance}
\item{\code{raw}}{returns a vector containing one score for each class}
\item{\code{binary}}{returns the score for the class specified by \code{positive}}
}}

\item{...}{further arguments to \code{\link{multiresponse_classification_metric}}}
}
\value{
A single score for the selected class if \code{multi = "binary"},
a vector containing one score for each class if \code{multi = "raw"},
a summary score computed by using the global metrics if \code{multi = "micro"} or
averaging the results from different classes if \code{multi = "macro"}. A summary score
produced by a weighted average of the results from different class is produced if
\code{multi = "weighted"}
}
\description{
This function computes the sensitivity.
}
\details{
The sensitivity measures the ability of a classifier of correctly predicting the presence of a condition.
It is defined as

\deqn{sensitivity = recall = \textit{true positive rate} (TPR) = \frac{TP}{P} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} = 1 - FNR}

The optimal value is 1 and the worst value is 0.
